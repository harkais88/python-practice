"""Write a Python program that reads the two adjoining sides and the diagonal 
of a parallelogram and checks whether the parallelogram is a rectangle or a rhombus.
According to Wikipedia-
parallelograms: In Euclidean geometry, a parallelogram is a simple (non-self-intersecting) 
quadrilateral with two pairs of parallel sides. The opposite or facing sides of a parallelogram 
are of equal length and the opposite angles of a parallelogram are of equal measure.
rectangles: In Euclidean plane geometry, a rectangle is a quadrilateral with four right angles. 
It can also be defined as an equiangular quadrilateral, since equiangular means that all of its 
angles are equal (360째/4 = 90째). It can also be defined as a parallelogram containing a right angle.
rhombus: In plane Euclidean geometry, a rhombus (plural rhombi or rhombuses) is a simple 
(non-self-intersecting) quadrilateral whose four sides all have the same length. Another 
name is equilateral quadrilateral, since equilateral means that all of its sides are equal 
in length. The rhombus is often called a diamond, after the diamonds suit in playing cards 
which resembles the projection of an octahedral diamond, or a lozenge, though the former 
sometimes refers specifically to a rhombus with a 60째 angle, and the latter sometimes 
refers specifically to a rhombus with a 45째 angle.
Input:
Two adjoined sides and the diagonal.
1 <= ai, bi, ci <= 1000, ai + bi > ci
Input two adjoined sides and the diagonal of a parallelogram (comma separated):
3,4,5
This is a rectangle."""

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Input two adjoined sides and the diagonal of a parallelogram (comma seperated):")
    ai,bi,ci = [float(i) for i in input().split(",")]

    if (ai + bi) < ci:
        print("Please enter valid input")
    else:
        if ai == bi:
            print("It is a rhombus")
        elif ai**2 + bi**2 == ci**2:
            print("It is a rectangle")
        else:
            print("It is neither a rectangle nor a rhombus")
