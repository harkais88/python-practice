# python-practice

This code generates a python test file consisting of questions taken from the files under the different topic directories. 10 questions are randomly chosen from each topic directory and are written to the test file.
The test file can be either in the format of a text file (.txt) or a notebook file (.ipynb). 
The option of which format is to be used is to be selected by the user using the GUI presented by the code.

To use, download the testGen.py script and atleast one of the different topic directories and put them in the same directory. Then, simply run the script and the GUI will be presented. Aternatively, you may want to convert the script into an .exe file using pyinstaller, for which I would suggest using a spec file for building exe.

All of these questions are taken from the W3Resource Website
