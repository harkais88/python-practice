# python-practice

This code generates a python test file consisting of questions taken from the files under the different topic directories. 10 questions are randomly chosen from each topic directory and are written to the test file.
The test file can be either in the format of a text file (.txt) or a notebook file (.ipynb). 
The option of which format is to be used is to be selected by the user using the GUI presented by the code.
